This project aims to be the starting point of an opensource realization of the
quite awesome iOS UI/UX concept of Reddit user Sendry, described in detail here:

    http://www.cultofmac.com/202652/heres-how-jony-ive-should-re-design-ios-7s-alerts-concept/

Tested on iPad 3 and iPhone 3GS on iOS 5.1.1.

Changelog:
 - v0.1 beta: implemented linen-textured alert views (portrait and portrai upside-down only at the moment)

TODOs:

 - Implement landscape mode (yeah, transforms are tricky)
 - Implement "extended" notifications
 - Test on more devices/OS versions
 - Any other idea?
